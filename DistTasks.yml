# Source: https://github.com/arduino/tooling-project-assets/blob/main/workflow-templates/assets/release-go-task/DistTasks.yml
version: "3"

# This taskfile is ideally meant to be project agnostic and could be dropped in
# on other Go projects with minimal or no changes.
#
# To use it simply add the following lines to your main taskfile:
#   includes:
#     dist: ./DistTasks.yml
#
# The following variables must be declared in the including taskfile for the
# build process to work correctly:
# * DIST_DIR: the folder that will contain the final binaries and packages
# * PROJECT_NAME: the name of the project, used in package name
# * VERSION: the version of the project, used in package name and checksum file
# * LD_FLAGS: flags used at build time
# * PROVISIONING_BINARIES_FOLDER: provisioning binaries folder. Remember to REMOVE binaries folder as soon as it is removed from the project  
#
# The project MUST contain a LICENSE.txt file in the root folder or packaging will fail.
